# AOC 2020

This is my code for the [Advent of Code 2020 challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

I'm not really making any effort for this code to be efficient. Just trying to get the answers right.

I'm testing this with gcc 8.3.1 and cmake 3.11.4.
* It'll probably work with a lot of other compilers. 
* I set the experimental C++20 flag, but it's unlikely I'll use any of those features.

## To build:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src
make
```

This generates the `aoc-2020` executable in the build directory. Command line help is available there.
